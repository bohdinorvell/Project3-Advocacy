                When starting this Advocacy project I was eager to start because with the unlimited possibilities for a visual document I decided to create a website from scratch. As I drew up this daunting task I realized it would be a challenge, as I am fairly new to coding in general and a website was something I have never done before. With my mode figured out for the assignment I now had to specifically decide what my message or opinion should be, this is when I thought about discussing and relaying informational resources about social media addiction and other negative effects. Some of my main strategies for this website would be to have a variety of information, resources, and content to keep viewers engaged. Additionally, I wanted to have a color theme that popped; I used yellow and black because of the inspiration and attention I felt drawn to the information on an example interactive website we viewed in class. With the content and style of the website complete I now had to plan on how I'm going to achieve being informative but easy to follow. This task would involve finding short and informative videos to help express my ideas with supplemental information and resources to be shared with the public. Doing this will allow me to reach my desired audience of any person that has social media; picking this audience seemed like the most logical choice because of the accessibility for my website to be shared amongst social media users who might gain insightful and even eye opening information. When looking at the product I have completed I am very proud of myself for a couple reasons, most of them being because of the time it took to learn, code, debug, format/layout the website, write responses for the actual assignment, and to publish a website. This project was not just an assignment, but felt like a passion because I got to fulfill the requirements in a new modality that involved a lengthy process. If I were to improve the website I would spend more time on additional and more complex features/visuals to engage with the audience better.

                This project has helped me with learning not just for different modalities for different audiences but with problem solving, planning, and revising. For the SLO #4 I was able to produce a variety of opinions, information, and studies done within the field of social media addiction and negative effects. By having differently formatted information on the website I am able to successfully spread different modalities to a large audience that additionally can react to the needs of each user accordingly. If a person was to end up on my website and they were in the mood for reading an opinion piece with factual information they could, they would also have an option to read about ways people are trying to change social media for the safety of themselves and younger users, or they could just watch a youtube video that has a certain stance within the discussion. These things are working together as a unit to also satisfy the SLO #5 requirements because it allows adaptability depending on the reader/viewer.
