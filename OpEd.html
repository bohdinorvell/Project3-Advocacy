                With technology advancing and increasing interactment among adolescents and children it is necessary to acknowledge the negative effects to ensure online safety in developing minds. In today's world it might be common to see children playing on their ipads, doing online learning, and even using technology to communicate with their friends; that is why balancing and monitoring the use of social media to prevent negative effects are important. These negative effects range in severity, but some notable behaviors or signs to look out for are social anxiety, addiction / over usage of social media to pass or kill time, dependency of certain apps, depression, isolation, eating disorders, and self-image issues. These effects of social media are common concerns in the general public and its users, a common concern in today's society is addiction to social media. Just because of the increase of social media use does not mean an addiction is automatically forming. Social media addiction is often a hobby or pass time done amongst children, adolescents, and even adults, but this can develop into a behavioral addiction to where your mood will be affected based on the amount of time spent on social media. The reason this is becoming a problem in our society is because of chemical and neurological signals that are releasing dopamine for example which makes your brain think that the social media use is what makes you “feel” happy. Additionally, the use of social media promotes isolation, laziness, and loneliness. Ways to look out for possible addiction in yourself or someone you know is if they think about using social media when doing other activities, negative performance in school/work, easy fatigue, and even emotional distress when unable to have access to their social media.

                Although these signs of social media addiction and other possible effects might be challenging to break, it can be done. This process can be started by recognizing there is a problem and coming to terms with the issues, this may include some reflection on why this may have happened and how to progressively get better. The next step would be to set boundaries for yourself and to initiate a plan whether its deleting social media from your phone and limiting usage in public, logging out of social media when in public to prevent usage, or even leaving your phone at home or on the counter when doing other activities. Once this is done it is recommended to pick up a new hobby/habit to replace the bad one, this can be cooking, art, working out, or even just making it a priority to see and catch up with friends and family. If these steps don’t work it might be best to reach out to a professional if breaking out of a social media addiction continues to be challenging.
