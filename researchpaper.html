            <h2>Online Platform Research on Negative Effects</h2>
                <p class="body"> 
                    The internet has brought innovative techniques that have now engrained themselves into our culture, connecting us with a multitude of opinions from around the world. As we approach the normalcy of the digital age, technology is being introduced to adolescents at ages as young as 3 years old. In 2019, it was reported that there had been a 75% jump in adults having regular online presence in the United States when compared to data from 2005 (Ortiz-Ospina). In 2023 we can only imagine the digital footprint of households across the U.S., who use the internet and online platforms not only in freetime, but for dependable income, learning activities, and work. However constant connection can be damaging, especially to developing minds. This is because while the internet has grown to be a virtual community where ideas, awareness, and culture are expressed, it also unintentionally created spaces for articulation of the perception of its users through comparison, cyberbullying, and sensitive content that is not advised for young and developing viewers (Mann). With this normalcy and ease of creating accounts for many online platforms, it is important to look at the negative effects these online platforms like social media have on the development and perception of our reality due to unrealistic standards. Or in some cases how videogames(a growing industry with advanced graphics, realistic sounds, and ways of becoming immersed into the game) are causing the users to have an addiction to the game that unintentionally lowers in real life interaction for its users. If we don’t take this issue about online platforms seriously then this could lead to damaging interpersonal skills and relationships, harmful effects to the mental health of the user, and could possibly lead to unhealthy habits and practices.

                <p class="body">
                    Damaging factors are all over the internet that are placed to cause negativity on certain users. Negative effects, such as mental health issues and body image issues, have been shown to
                    have a factor of cyberbullying playing into further development. Building an understanding of cyberbullying is important because it is a recurring issue within these negative effects of online platforms. Cyberbullying is defined by Merriam-Webster as “the electronic posting of mean-spirited messages about a person (such as a student) often done anonymously” which shows the malicity in this problem due to purposeful anonymously written attacks on other users (Merriam-Webster). In a lot of cases, verification of a user's identity is not required for online
                    number gives users with intent the ability to negatively affect other users under an anonymous account with no personal repercussions. Cyberbullying within these online platforms do range in direct effects on the users like stress, depression, anxiety, negative thoughts about appearance or their personality, and some even suicidal ideations due to constant online harassment (Greenwood). While these platforms eventually do address cyberbullying accounts by suspending or banning, the negative effects and ideas are already damaging the victims emotionally and mentally.
                </p>

                <p class="body"> 
                    Cyberbullying and harassment online has a tendency to leave victims with negative thoughts about themselves where suicidal ideations are able to form because of the negative treatment they encounter. These encounters also have the ability to lead the victims to growing lifetime mental health issues that include self isolation, anxiety, self harm, and can also make the user self conscious about their appearance and body image. When looking at case studies done on suicide based on the influence of social media, it was determined that “adolescent patient testimonials outline the torture of cyberbullying tactics, and a substantial body of evidence consistently correlates these experiences with suicidal behaviors” showing the drastic type of
                    platforms. Simply by inputting a name, the user can pick with a valid email address or phone
                    effects cyberbullying can have on a person (Niles 14). Additionally, there have been other studies that observe the risks of social media and online platforms that showed effects on their mental health determined bullying and trolling to be a danger to the users of the online platforms (O’Reilly 203). Furthermore, while usage of online platforms might not directly translate to depression or anxiety overtime depending on the usage and the interactions you have while being online, it can be seen as a factor that increases or amplifies depression or loneliness in studied students (Aalbers 1455). When looking at Michelle O’Rieilly’s study on social media and the good, bad, and ugly effects it has, evidence deemed that “externalised issues like bullying were also considered alongside internalised issues such as self-harm and suicidal ideation, which are argued to be directly connected to social media.” showing the idea of mentally internalized problems can surface due to the usage of online platforms like social media and cyberbullying that occurs there (O’Reilly 203). When keeping this in mind it allows for other studies on the same issues to be understood more accurately with an example being from the study of depression symptoms when referenced to online platforms stating, “previous fatigue and loneliness predicted PSMU(passive social media use), indicating that these symptoms might lead participants to scroll through social media pages” which after knowing information from O’Reilly’s study allows for connections between studies to be made and how social media and other online platforms have the ability to keep users online due to previous levels of mental health issues (Aalbers 1458). But these negative mental health effects of online platforms also can transfrom into a physical form, specifically body image related issues and anxiety due to the sensitive and falsified content posted on these online platforms.

                <p class="body"> 
                    Anxiety that is built up through presence online is also associated with body image related issues forming because of cyberbullying and the idea of having to look perfect for others in a false reality. In a study observing the relationship between social appearance anxiety and the use of online platforms like social media, it was shown that women have higher levels of social appearance anxiety compared to men and that “social appearance anxiety might represent a main issue in other potentially negative outcomes, for example eating disorders” (Boursier 5). Eating disorders whether it is overeating or undereating due to comments online about a user's weight are considered an unhealthy practice because the methods are extreme to achieve goals that can be reached in a more sustainable way like dieting for a caloric surplus or deficit depending on the goals of the user. Body image issues with the active use of social media tend to involve both conscious and subconscious comparisons to people who are actively creating a false personal conception of themselves. This is because of the culture of the current generation and how we try to please others and show off, making life seem more interesting and the image of yourself perfect and nonrealistic. A supplementary idea to this concept of creating and making your social appearance perfect is that it creates an unhealthy mindset and way of achieving approval of yourself. By making looks appear more attractive to desired audiences, followers, friends, or even love interests it also makes a person change the things that make them who they are. Studies are starting to show that “higher exposure to visual content on social media might lead to more social comparisons and appearance concerns reinforcement. Therefore, body image-based digital activities might allow dissatisfied individuals with their appearance to create and manage their best online self presentation” which support this idea of online platforms being used to make the appearance of its users more perfect and beautiful ultimately creating a community full of dissolution and unhealthy ways of obtaining satisfaction with one persons self (Boursier 1).
                    Another point that could also play apart in the idea of creating a false perception of oneself on these platforms is because of wanting to appeal to other people, in the study on social appearance anxiety it was stated that “Boys (compared to girls) appeared to indicate that excitement, sexual fantasies, and feelings were important aspects of selfies. With regard to appearance concerns, according to previous studies.” (Boursier 4). Additionally, this idea of creating the best looking presentation of yourself for others to interact with and admire could lead to another negative consequence of online platforms, addiction.

                <p class="body">
                    Addiction is an unhealthy habit when we talk about online platform usages like social media and videogames. Being addicted to a certain aspect of an online platform does not just lead to overusage but to harmful behaviors and ways of thinking. In todays society the image of a person online and its performance directly affects the happiness of whoever posts it seeking for approval because they are caught up on the attention it brings them. But the reality is that, the necessity of posting pictures that are inauthentic of a persons genuine self to obtain satisfaction in numbers of likes and comments is becoming an obsessive trend on these online platforms, in other words an addiction. I personally see this happening in my friends online that will post a series of pictures and then take them down, only to later on be reposted exactly the same in the future because the attention it got the first time wasn’t to their level of satisfaction. This obsessive idea is an addiction that I feel is under talked about when looking at online platforms. Additionally, the higher usage of these online platforms are ruining and corrupting the human interaction skills within developing minds because they are spending the majority of their time communicating through a device rather than to a person directly. Interpersonal interaction is also a declining skill within other online platforms like videogames (Yang 11). As videogames are
                    becoming more interactive and realistic, it allows for deeper immersion into the game by whoever plays it. This allows players to get “trapped” by the game for periods of time due to competitiveness or missions they need to complete. This is especially true today when you are able to play a large variety of multiplayer games on consoles like Virtual Reality where it is easy to build up ways of interacting with players in game through voice chat, text chat, and movements done with the controls. While this might create interpersonal reactions online digitally, it is harming and affecting person to person connections in the real world (Yang 11). Ontop of the interpersonal interactions and relationships that are affected due to online platform addiction, there are other issues that tend to stem off of addiction like cyberbullying other users which has already been discussed as a negative effect, productivity decrease, lack of exercise, isolation, and even lack of sleep that derives from the constant videogame playing or scrolling on a feed of social media posts for entertainment. Online platform addiction can have ranges of negative effects on an individual's mental health, relationships, and productivity. Knowing these effects are important when deciding on the time you can allocate to online platform usage without the digital world affecting you in the real world.

                <p class="body">
                    When considering and looking at these negative effects of online platforms, it is equally important to look at the benefits that form aswell. As online platforms develop and become more powerful, so do the resources it offers. We can see this development in platforms like youtube, instagram, twitch, and even tik tok as what was one used as a platform to share experiences, ideas, gameplay, and skits has now become platforms where you are able to earn high paying salaries that allow for work to be done remotely. These developments in possibilities on online platforms easily allow for work to be done at home during times like a pandemic, where
                    platforms like TikTok were being used by large populations to watch videos of everyone locked up at home. Additional developments that come with these online platforms are the connections that come with building a profile with friends and family that makes it easy to communicate and connect during times like a pandemic. I know my family used online platforms like facebook to share how we celebrated lockdown birthdays and celebrations away from family and friends. Along with these easily accessible forms of communication, services like education and learning are now possible online due to other platforms that range from secondary language websites to learning how to code with free courses offered online. Online platforms do have negatives like cyberbullying which can turn into other issues like body image or mental health problems, but the positives leave for any person to create work for themselves to earn great salaries, let connections and communication between communities to be possible like never before, and expands the accessibility of knowledge for any subject imaginable. Are these benefits strong enough to outweigh the negatives? That is ultimately up to the user and or caregiver of the user to decide if these benefits outweigh any of the negative outcomes when discussing online platform use.

                    After examination of studies and information gathered on this topic of online platforms having negative effects on its users after certain usage points. This research allows for readers to understand the dangers and negativity such a powerful tool like the internet can have. It also gives insight into how it is happening to large amounts of people and not just a single person. While the internet can be good, ultimately the cyberbullying that happens on these platforms can lead to depression, anxiety, or body image issues and the addiction that can come with constant active use are corrupting the developing minds of the users. These effects online platforms have
                    are common concerns in the general public and users of online platforms, “specifically, in relation to risks to mental wellbeing, participants described three ways in which social media was ‘dangerous’. First, they argued that social media use directly causes stress, depression, low self-esteem and suicidal ideation. Second, they reported that social media exposes people to bullying and trolling, thereby negatively impacting mental health. Third, social media was constructed as addictive.” (O’Reilly). Additionally, the horrible mindsets created by comparison to falsified lifestyles and looks that are crowding the online platforms we scroll through are corrupting minds daily. With addiction being a more extreme negative effect it is important to monitor use and time spent on these online platforms because it is showing to lower interpersonal interactions and relationships within people who are active on internet platforms. It also creates for a bad habit and practice to put online platforms, games, and selfie posts before real life issues like exercise, working a job, going to school, and building relationship and communication skills. These innovative online platforms can be a great tool but can also hold access of unintentional negativity through the comparisons, cyberbullying, and sensitive content that is being delivered to users across the world (Mann). If we don’t take this issue about online platforms seriously then this could lead to damaging interpersonal skills and relationships, harmful effects to the mental health of the user, and could possibly lead to unhealthy habits and practices. In light of these negative aspects of online platforms, what steps can be taken to lower the affected population and to promote welcoming environments online? Can these communities of cyberbullies ever be stopped?
